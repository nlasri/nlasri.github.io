# Why Data Science

I really like Data Science!

* This is a field that is evolving a lot and that, I think, will continue to evolve in the coming years. It allows me to always learn and test new methods.

* Data Science can be combined to many different domains. It allows me to discover and work with different professions than mine.

* The Data Science news always impresses me and makes me want to understand all the Data Science systems.


# Out of work

Besides Data Science, I have several hobbies. 

I like to travel to different countries and cultures. I was able to discover Morocco, Spain, Poland, Ireland, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, etc.

I also like to watch movies and series in my free time.

Here are my top 3 favorite movies
